The {mt} package provides a framework for compartmental modelling. The ideas were gathered over many years of writing code for mathematical models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("uct-masha/mt")
```

## Getting started

To get started with some files, first create/load your modelling project in RStudio. Next, enter the following into the console:

``` r
mt::use_mt()
```

You will now want to edit some stuff, but this documentation will need to be developed with the package.
